During this internship I developed a reactive trajectory planner for robots operating in unstructured environments using Siemens Tecnomatix
Process Simulate for 3D manufacturing simulation.


Designed and implemented a 3-layer module (C# WPF UI → C++/CLI interop → native C++) to process RGB-D
snapshots, convert depth buffers to world-frame point clouds, remove robot geometry, and feed filtered data to
real-time collision checking and path-replanning logic.
