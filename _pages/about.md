# About Me

Hi there, I’m Giulio 👋

I recently graduated with an MSc in Applied Mathematics from the University of Strasbourg (France). I’m passionate about software engineering, data science, and machine learning.

## A bit about my journey 😄
I am originally from Italy and I moved to France after high school to pursue mathematics. Over the past six years, I’ve lived, studied, and worked abroad.

## Professional Experience

**Siemens Digital Industries Software** – Toulouse, France (Internship)  
Developed a reactive trajectory-planning module for industrial robotic arms inside Siemens top PLM software Process Simulate. Designed and implemented a three-layer architecture (C# WPF UI → C++/CLI interop → native C++) that processes RGB-D data from depth cameras, converts it to world-frame point clouds, removes robot self-geometry, and feeds filtered data into real-time collision detection and path-replanning systems.

**Cemosis** (Center for Modeling and Simulation, Strasbourg – CNRS spinoff) (Internship)  
Optimized 3D terrain mesh generation pipelines for finite element simulations in urban energy modeling.Developed a C++ pipeline using constrained Delaunay triangulation (CGAL) and Mapbox Terrain-RGB API elevation data.
