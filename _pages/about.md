# About Me

Hi there, I’m Giulio 👋

I recently graduated with an MSc in Applied Mathematics from the University of Strasbourg. I’m passionate about software engineering, data science, and machine learning.

## A bit about my journey 😄
Originally from Florence, Italy, I moved to France right after high school to pursue mathematics. Over the past six years, I’ve lived, studied, and worked abroad, becoming fluent in English and French while developing the global perspective and adaptability essential in today’s tech landscape.

## Professional Experience

**Siemens Digital Industries Software** – Toulouse, France (Intern)  
Developed a reactive trajectory-planning module for robots in unstructured environments using Siemens Process Simulate. Designed and implemented a three-layer architecture (C# WPF UI → C++/CLI interop → native C++) that processes RGB-D snapshots, converts depth buffers to world-frame point clouds, removes robot self-geometry, and feeds filtered data into real-time collision detection and path-replanning systems.

**Cemosis** (Center for Modeling and Simulation, Strasbourg – CNRS spinoff) (Intern)  
Optimized 3D terrain mesh generation pipelines for finite element simulations in urban energy modeling.

## Areas of Expertise
- Software engineering, data science, and machine learning.
- Numerical methods for PDEs, scientific simulation, optimization, and high-performance computing.

## Technical Skills

**Programming Languages & Frameworks**  
C/C++, C#, C++/CLI, Python, R, SQL/NoSQL, Bash.

**Key Libraries & Tools**  
TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, CGAL, .NET (WPF), OpenCL, MPI.

**Machine Learning & AI**  
Regression, Classification, Clustering, Neural Networks (ANN, RNN, CNN), Deep Learning, Generative Models, Scientific Machine Learning, Uncertainty Quantification.

**Modeling, Simulation & Optimization**  
Numerical Methods for PDEs, Finite Element/Volume Methods, Mesh Generation, Point Cloud Processing, Optimization Techniques, High-Performance Computing.

**Tools & Practices**  
Git/GitHub, Docker, CI/CD, Visual Studio, Agile/Scrum.

## Outside of work
On my free time I run 🏃🏻‍♂️, swim 🏊‍♂️ and play chess ♟️.
