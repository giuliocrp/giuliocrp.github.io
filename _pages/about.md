### Hi there, I am Giulio 👋

I graduated in August 2025 with a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of
Strasbourg, France. I am passionate about software engineering, data science,
and machine learning.

### A little bit about me 😄

After earning an international high-school diploma in Florence, Italy, I moved to
France to study mathematics at the University of Strasbourg. Studying abroad allowed me to gain global perspectives and foster both personal and professional growth.

My most recent internship was at 
[Siemens Digital Industries Software](https://www.sw.siemens.com/en-US/),
where I worked on reactive trajectory planning for robots operating in
unstructured environments simulated using Siemens' Process Simulate

Before that, I interned at [Cemosis](https://www.cemosis.fr), the Center for
Modeling and Simulation in Strasbourg. There, I focused on optimizing 3D terrain
mesh generation for finite element simulations in urban energy modeling.

My expertise is in software engineering, data science and machine learning. I also have a strong background in numerical methods for partial differential equations, simulation,
optimization, and high performance computing. I am proficient in Python and C++.


### Skills

- **Programming Languages**: C/C++, C#, C++/CLI, Python, R, SQL, Bash
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, OpenTurns.
- **Tools/Software**: Visual Studio 2022, Git/Git Extensions, GitHub, Docker, CI/CD tools.
- **Numerical Methods**: PDEs, Finite Element Methods, Model Order Reduction.
- **Methodologies**: Agile, Scrum



### Outside of work 🏃‍♂️

When I'm not working on software or data projects, I enjoy staying active through running and swimming. I'm currently training for my first marathon, which has been an exciting and challenging journey!
