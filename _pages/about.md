Hi, I’m Giulio 👋

I recently completed my Master's degree in Applied Mathematics at the
University of Strasbourg. I’m passionate about Mathematics, Software
Engineering and Machine Learning.

## Background
I am originally from Florence, Italy and I moved to France after high school
to study maths. Over the past six years, I’ve lived, studied, and worked abroad.

## Experience

### Siemens Digital Industries Software (Internship)  
I developed a reactive trajectory-planning module for industrial robotic arms
inside Siemens top PLM software Process Simulate. Designed and implemented a
three-layer architecture (C# WPF UI → C++/CLI interop → native C++) that
processed RGB-D data (point clouds) from depth cameras in real-time, converted
it to world-frame coordinate, removed robot self-geometry, and fed filtered
data into collision detection and path-replanning system.

### Cemosis – CNRS spin-off (Internship)  
I built a C++ application to optimize 3D terrain mesh generation for
finite element simulations in urban energy modeling. The pipeline sourced
elevation data for any given area using Mapbox Terrain-RGB API, processed it
and used CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library) to create a Delaunay
mesh constrained to contour lines.
