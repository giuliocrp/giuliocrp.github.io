### Hi there, I am Giulio ðŸ‘‹

I'm a MSc student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Strasbourg, France. I am passionate about software engineering, data science and machine learning.

### A little bit about me ðŸ˜„

After an international high-school diploma in Florence, Italy, I moved to France to study mathematics at the University of Strasbourg.
I wanted to pursued studies abroad to gain global perspectives and foster personal and professional growth. I am currently enrolled in a Master's program in Applied Mathematics, and doing an internship at [Siemens Digital Industries Software](https://www.sw.siemens.com/en-US/), where I am working on reactive trajectory planning for robots operating in unstructured environments.

Previously I interned at [Cemosis](https://www.cemosis.fr), the Center for Modeling and Simulation in Strasbourg, where I worked on
optimizing 3D terrain mesh generation for finite element simulations in urban energy modeling.

My expetise is in software engineering, data science and machine learning, as well as in numerical methods for partial differential equations, simulation and optimization as well as scientific and high performance computing. I have a strong background in Python and C++.
